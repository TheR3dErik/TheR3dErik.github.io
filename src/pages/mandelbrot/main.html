            <p>This is made using WebGL. All calculations are done in a fragment shader. 
                Since WebGL (and OpenGL in general) doesn't like to use floats with more precision than 32 bits, 
                it doesn't take much zooming to hit the limit on this. Nevertheless, I still think it's pretty cool. 
                I will try experimenting soon with increasing precision.</p>
            <p>Click and drag with the mouse or use the arrow keys to pan around. To zoom, use the scroll wheel, or press 'i' to zoom in and 'o' to zoom out.</p>
