            <p>While learning electrostatics for AP physics, my book made the claim that in an electrically neutral conductor, the electric field inside is zero and there is only a net charge on the surface.</p>
            <p>So, I decided to try to get some more intuition for this claim by simulating a conductor as seen above. The positive nuclei of atoms are fixed in place and their electrons are free to flow around.
                 I simply use Coulomb's law to calculate the attraction between every charge, and even with this many charges, it works well enough with javascript.
            </p>
            <p>I did make a slight modification to Coulomb's law. Basically, it seems that the charge only settles on the surface in 3 dimensions because the electric force obeys an inverse-square relationship with distance.
                 However, this is a 2 dimensional simulation, so to get the same behavior, an inverse-square law no longer works. Instead, I modified it to be only inverse.
            </p>
            <p>This is still somewhat low resolution as far as atoms and electrons in a conductor go, so the result doesn't seem to be very clearly visible. But still, it does seem to work pretty well just by looking at it 
               (which admittedly isn't a very rigorous metric). Some further changes I could make to pursue this further would be to rewrite it in C++ to get enough of a performance boost to allow a finer grid to be simulated.</p>
